## Description

### Header with exchange rate
The header should display the current exchange rate (USD, EUR) against the hryvnia (UAH)
The current exchange rate must come from any public API

### Component with conversion
- One currency must have its own input and select.
- a separate input + select for the first currency, and a separate input + select for the second currency
- input is given a number to indicate the number of units to convert
- select must contain at least three currencies - UAH, USD, EUR.
- conversion must occur in both directions
- when changing the value in the first currency, the value in the second must be recalculated, and vice versa
- when changing the currency in each select, the conversion of both currencies should be recalculated correctly

### The advantage will be:
Well thought out interface and appearance
Clean code
